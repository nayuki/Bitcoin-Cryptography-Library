/*
 * A point on the secp256k1 elliptic curve for Bitcoin use, in projective coordinates.
 * Contains methods for computing point addition, doubling, and multiplication, and testing equality.
 * The ordinary affine coordinates of a point is (x/z, y/z). Instances of this class are mutable.
 * 
 * Points MUST be normalized before comparing for equality. Example of correct usage:
 *   CurvePoint a(...);
 *   CurvePoint b(...);
 *   CurvePoint c(...);
 *   
 *   a.add(b);
 *   a.multiply(50);
 *   
 *   a.normalize();
 *   c.normalize();
 *   if (a == c) { ... }
